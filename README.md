# Bike_sharing

## Overview
This project is to create a proposal for a citi bike (bikesharing) business for investors. The goal aims at citi bike data in New York City in the month of August to see how this bikesharing business operates in its peak during summer. After analyzing the data, I then created visualizations to display the trends and opportunities, my insights are as follows:

## Results

### ![August Peak Hours](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100484606/173172883-661f57d0-f75a-445e-864c-23fd6ff65e40.JPG)

* Based on the bar chart, the top riding hours during August in New York City are from 5:00pm to 7:00pm. This is the most active time during the day in August

* Based on the data in bar chart, the least active riding times are from 2:00am to 5:00 am , so fewer bikes are needed which makes it a good time to do maintenance

### ![Average Trip Duration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100484606/173177217-b33bd683-3919-425a-90d2-85d05d42e771.JPG)

* Age related to the length of a bike ride: In general, the younger the longer the ride duration.

### ![Trips by weekday per hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100484606/173177417-f5ae380b-5359-4a8d-8103-b926f3ba6992.JPG)

* During August, the most active hours in which people used the bikes is 5:00pm and 6:00pm and 8:00 am the morning. This can be concluded that the trend that people usually use bikes for going to work as the peak hours are before and after working time.

* The heatmap also approves that how the most heated and active times are 8:00am and 5-6 pm during workdays. It can be seen that thursday is the most active day of the week, and that saturday and sundays' afternoons are also very popular for bikesharing.

* As it can be seen that almost 80% of the users are subscribers, meanwhile the others are just customers who sometimes are not regular customers. This means that we should pay attention to have some strategies to increase the number of regular customers to register to become subscriber. It is very obvious that male subscribers are the most active users followed by female subscribers.

* In this chart, we can see the trip duration by gender. All genders usually use the bikes for around 5 minutes. After that, the trip durations start to drop down. Almost nobody uses the bikes for more thatn 45 minutes where it is shown in the chart that the line slop down significantly.

* Here we can see the gender breakdown in both sides of the chart, which shows that the majority of customers are male with more than 60%. They all happen to have the same heatmap which shows how they have the same behavior on using bikes at the same times (8am and 5-6pm on weekday and from 10am to 7pm at weekend).

## Summary

* In order to have more factors to put into consideration, we can create one more visualization in which we observed rides by age. The age was calculated by the year of birth and the year of the dataset collected which was in 2019. As it can be seen, users from 17 years old are able to use the bikes. Male users around 30 years old are the ones who used the most bikes. Also, there is a outlier at 52 years old for 'unknown' gender with over 200,000 rides. This data should be an alert to analyze the reasons because it might be affecting our results.

* It would be better if we can analyze the dataset together with the weather data in the city to see if the weather can be a factor that affects the business.
